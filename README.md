# XMobile_CI-CD
This repo holds script(s) for building and pushing APKs &amp; IPAs from Cross Mobile Platform code
The `.sh` script was tested on React Native. But should work on Flutter too.
More and more features will be added to this script to support building with flags and even deploying builds to Stores/Vaults
